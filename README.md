# Sudoku

1.) Sudoku.py
    Command Line Game of Sudoku. 
    You must enter the X and Y coodinate on the grid
    and the value you would like to enter into the grid.
    
    a.) If the value you entered is correct. The game will return a "correct" statement
        and the board game will be displayed with the new added value.
    b.) If you entered a coordinate value that already has the correct value, the game will not allow you to
        enter a new value in that place.
    c.) If you entered the incorrect value, the game will return a "Wrong statement" and will not display the
        Sudoku grid.

2.) GUI.py
    At the moment, this code is from https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/
    It is an introduction to pygame. 
    
    I am trying to learn about pygame first and then I will like to turn my Sudoku game into a GUI instead of a a command line game.
